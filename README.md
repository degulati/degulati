### Hi, I'm Dev ðŸ‘‹

I'm a recent graduate from UC San Diego (Class of 2021), where I studied MechE & CS with a focus in robotics. I'm currently looking for internship/full-time opportunities as a software engineer! Feel free to get in touch at degulati@ucsd.edu.

### ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on

I'm interning at the Mechanical Systems Control Lab @ UC Berkeley, where I'm conducting research on motion planning in autonomous driving over the summer. I'm also part of TritonAI @ UCSD and am working on programming a 1/10-scale RC car that drives autonomously for the upcoming [DIY Robocars competition](https://www.meetup.com/DIYRobocars/events/278392566/) in August in Oakland, CA.

### âš¡ Fun facts

* I like to run & play tennis
* I'm trilingual and can speak English, Hindi, & Japanese
* I was part of a dance team @ UCSD

I'm excited to learn and apply my knowledge and skills in industry as entry-level engineer!
