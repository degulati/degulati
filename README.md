### Hi, I'm Dev ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Master's student at UC San Diego and also completed my Bachelor's at UCSD, where I studied MechE & CS. I'm currently looking for internship opportunities in software engineering and data science. Feel free to reach me at degulati@ucsd.edu.

### ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on

I recently started my MS program at UCSD! This fall, I'm taking coursework in Computer science including the Design & Analysis of Algorithms (CSE 202), AI: Probabilistic Reasoning and Learning (CSE 250A), and Recommender Systems & Web Mining (CSE 258). 

At UCSD, I'm also a part of Triton AI [https://tritonai.org/], where I've worked on exploring and deploying the full autonomous driving stack on a 1/10-scale RC car for the DIY Robocars [https://diyrobocars.com/] Race that takes place every few months in Oakland, CA. 

### âš¡ Fun facts

* I like to run & play tennis
* I'm trilingual and can speak English, Hindi, & Japanese
* I was part of a competitive dance team @ UCSD

I'm excited to learn and apply my knowledge and skills in industry as entry-level engineer!
